// REVIEW: do we want to put all stats in one struct? Or let each file (fusedav.c,
// filecache.c, statcache.c) define its own?
// I would prefer: limit fusedav.c, filecache.c, and statcache.c to fusedav,
// filecache, statcache core activities; and do other things like inject_error,
// stats, etc in separate files, like this.
